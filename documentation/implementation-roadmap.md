# Crypto Trader Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for developing the Crypto Trader application, a cryptocurrency portfolio management and automated trading system. The roadmap is organized in order of implementation priority to ensure efficient development, minimize redundancy, and maintain best practices throughout the project.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Infrastructure

### 1.1 Project Structure Refinement
- [x] Initialize frontend (React + TypeScript with Vite)
- [x] Initialize backend (FastAPI)
- [x] Standardize backend file structure following FastAPI best practices:
  ```
  backend/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── api/           # API routes by feature
  │   ├── core/          # Core configuration
  │   ├── models/        # Database models
  │   ├── schemas/       # Pydantic schemas
  │   ├── crud/          # Database operations
  │   ├── services/      # Business logic
  │   └── utils/         # Utility functions

## Backend Rebuild Plan - Next Steps

After encountering persistent import errors in the previous implementation, we're rebuilding the backend with a focus on a clean, consistent structure. Here's the plan:

### Step 1: Initial Setup
- [x] Create a fresh FastAPI project structure
- [x] Set up a proper virtual environment
- [x] Install and lock dependencies with specific versions
- [x] Create a proper `.env` file and environment handling
- [x] Configure logging with a focus on clarity and diagnostics

### Step 2: Core Configuration
- [x] Implement settings with Pydantic BaseSettings
- [x] Set up logging configuration
- [x] Create security utilities
- [x] Implement proper exception handling

### Step 3: Database Integration
- [ ] Connect to Supabase with proper error handling
- [ ] Implement base CRUD operations
- [ ] Set up models for all database tables
- [ ] Create Pydantic schemas for validation
- [ ] Implement Row Level Security

### Step 4: API Implementation
- [ ] Create authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement user management
- [ ] Set up proper dependency injection
- [ ] Build the central API router
- [ ] Implement middleware for security and logging

### Best Practices for Rebuild
- Use absolute imports exclusively
- Ensure all files have consistent encoding (UTF-8)
- Implement proper error handling at all levels
- Maintain a clear separation of concerns
- Test each component incrementally
- Document code as it's developed

## Completed Backend Fixes

### 1. Encoding Issues Resolution (March 8, 2025)
- [x] Identified and fixed critical null bytes issue in Python files
  - Problem: `SyntaxError: source code string cannot contain null bytes` was preventing server startup
  - Found that all `__init__.py` files contained null bytes (0x00)
  - Used PowerShell to identify affected files: `Get-ChildItem -Path "app" -Recurse -Filter "*.py" | ForEach-Object { $file = $_; Get-Content -Path $file.FullName -Encoding Byte | Where-Object { $_ -eq 0 } | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "Null byte found in $($file.FullName)" } }`
  - Solution: Deleted all affected files and recreated them with proper UTF-8 encoding
  - Created standardized content in each file to document its purpose
  - Successfully verified fix by starting the server and accessing API endpoints

## Implementation Order Rationale

This roadmap follows a logical progression that:

1. **Establishes foundational elements first** (project structure, database, authentication)
2. **Builds core functionality incrementally** (exchange connections, portfolio management, trading)
3. **Adds advanced features after core functionality is stable**
4. **Ensures quality through comprehensive testing**
5. **Finalizes with proper documentation and maintenance plans**

By following this order, we ensure that:
- Each feature builds upon stable, tested components
- Core functionality is prioritized over nice-to-have features
- Technical debt is minimized through consistent best practices
- The application can be tested and validated at each stage
- Development efforts focus on delivering value in an incremental manner
